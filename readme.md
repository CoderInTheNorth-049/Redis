## Why Build Redis?
Redis exposes you to basic data structures and system programming (mainly network programming).

> “What I cannot create, I do not understand” - Richard Feynman

## Why C?
C was, is, and will be widely used for system programming and infrastructure software. And C is unavoidable for learning low-level stuff.
