# Section-10  The AVL Tree: Coding & Testing
- In this section we didn't made any changes in previous codes but created 2 new files `avl.cpp` and `test_avl.cpp`.
- `avl.cpp` contains main functionalities for AVL tree like right and left rotations, measuring depth, etc. Mostly functions which are related to balancing the AVL Tree.
- `test_avl.cpp` contains addition and deletion of nodes and also respective functions for testing and verification of balanced AVL Tree for different case like duplicate insertion,after insertion or after deletion of node.


## How to run?
compile `test_avl.cpp` and run it.
```
g++ test_avl.cpp -o test
./test
```
If no error has been thrown by code then we have successfully implemented the AVL Tree (There will be no output in case of successful execution).
